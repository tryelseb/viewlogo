                         making a legally binding offer to sell that design, on an exclusive basis, to the buyer who has
                         posted the
                         project. Should the buyer accept the design and purchase the same, the designer/vendor has
                         legally
                         concluded the sale of that design and must follow though with the sale as the sale is a part of
                         a binding

                         agreed upon deliverables as promptly as possible and always prior to being paid.
